A rectangle has side lengths of $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$.A hard return is going to start a new paragraph.\\
A rectangle has side lengths of $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$. \textbackslash\textbackslash\ is a soft return and therefore the line is not indented.

The equation $${A(x)=x^2+4x+3}$$ gives the area of the rectangle.\\
